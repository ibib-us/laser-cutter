Information related to the laser cutter at IBiB

# General settings

## 1/8 inch basswood

- vector cutting: 35 speed, 80 power
- raster engraving: 100 speed, 60 power

## construction paper (3 mm thick)

- vector cutting: 100 speed, 30 power
- raster engraving: 100 speed, 29 power (can probably go higher)

## acrylic (1.5 mm thick)

- vector cutting: 50 speed, 80 power.
- raster engraving: 100 speed, 80 power.
- Note: 3.0 mm thick was not cut through at 30 speed 80 power, but was close enough to be snapped. Might need to increase power to 90. Also need to mind the other with this thickness.

# Tips and tricks

- When engraving and cutting, to preserve the same shape, change the color of the outline vector to yellow. Then, when engraving, a threshold of 165 will cause the yellow to not display and the engraving will be positions correctly in relation to the vector outline
